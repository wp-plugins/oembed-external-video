oEmbed External Video plugin converts any external mp4 url into HTML5 video tag 

== Description ==

oEmbed External Video plugin converts any external mp4 url into HTML5 video tag. This plugins is needed because WordPress oEmbed only converts urls from supported oEmbed providers. This plugin is most useful for BuddyPress Communities where members post urls to external mp4 videos in the Group and activity feeds which automatically then get embedded.

To put any external mp4 video file into a post, page, BuddyPress Activity or Group feed, simply place URL link to the mp4 video file as separate paragraph. The plugin will convert it into the HTML5 video player on the page. See screenshots.

Plugin settings page allows you to change the video player width, height, controls, autoplay, loop and muted options.
